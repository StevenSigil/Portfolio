                    I have always had an eye for detail. In 2014, an opportunity
                    to expand on detail-oriented type skills was presented in
                    the form of digital media and graphic design. I took the
                    opportunity and attended vocational school where I learned
                    how to create things that people liked. Being young and
                    rebellious, as soon as school was concluded, I dropped it
                    all to pursue a career climbing corporate ladders. Very
                    quickly, it became apparent the ladders were slick, hard to
                    hang on to, and usually lead to a cliff.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Eventually, I could not ignore the inner voice who was
                    screaming "This isn't you!". I put my pride to the side and
                    became reacquainted with multi-media in my free time while
                    serving as a manager in a retail environment.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    While still in a managerial role, I decided it could be
                    useful to know more about working with large amounts of
                    data. This led me to begin using Python for data-analysis.
                    After a while, it was getting rather boring to get the
                    answers to a question but have no one be impressed. This led
                    to me building web interfaces that acted as "interactive
                    reports" and allowed me to learn to integrate more practices
                    from the digital media skills previously acquired. After a
                    while of trying, failing, and trying again, I realized the
                    time came to be done walking the corporate path I was on and
                    travel the original road I was meant to be on.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    A few weeks after that realization, I left my job, and spent
                    the next several months learning to code...
                  </p>
                  {/* For years, I have been working to make headway in the
                  corporate world. While on that path, certain circumstances

                  Eventually I decided to put my pride to the side and do what I
                  should have been doing years ago. <br /> Learn to code! */}

                    Over these last several months, I have completed two
                    in-depth courses covering the Python language, 2 courses
                    using Python with Jupyter to perform data analysis and learn
                    best practices for those jobs, a course covering almost all
                    aspects of front-end development and NoSQL databases
                    (including JavaScript, React, Express, MongoDB,
                    authentication techniques, design specific best practices,
                    etc...), a course covering backend (and some frontend)
                    development using Django and Django-Rest-Framework, amongst
                    a few smaller courses.

                    Since my past realizations, I've decided the quickest way to
                    break into the 'Tech' industry, given my work ethic, was to
                    enroll in self-paced bootcamps. I am happy to say I have
                    completed multiple bootcamp style corses in under 4 months,
                    and am on track to completing 2 more by the end of March!

                    build applications that are interesting, or fulfill a need
